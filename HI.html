		<h3>Subhas Chandra Bose </h3>

		British rule with the help of Nazi Germany and Japan left a troubled legacy.  
		The honorific Netaji (Hindustani language: "Respected Leader"), first applied to Bose in Germany,  
		by the Indian soldiers of the Indische Legion and by the German and Indian officials  
		in the Special Bureau for India in Berlin, in early 1942, is now used widely throughout India. -source Wikipedia</p>

He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology</p>
